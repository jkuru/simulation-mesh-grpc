# servicemesh (monorepo)

Header-driven **service virtualization** for gRPC — a **platform-engineering**
training ground: sample app → mesh literacy → control plane → **golden path**.

One request header — `test-data-simulation-action-name` — selects a scenario.
Real internal services stay real. Only third-party egress is virtualized.

---

## Golden path (what you should use)

**App teams and platform acceptance** use this path only:

1. Install **virtualization-framework**  
2. Deploy workloads (mesh mode) + apply **SimulationManifest**  
3. Label `simulation.io/propagation=enabled`  
4. Send traffic with the simulation header  

```bash
# Offline platform checks (coverage + goldens + example safety)
make platform-accept

# Full cluster golden path (kind + Istio required)
CLUSTER=servicemesh KEEP_CLUSTER=1 make platform-e2e
```

Recipe: [`examples/reference-app-with-framework`](examples/reference-app-with-framework/)  
Contract: [`docs/GOLDEN_PATH.md`](docs/GOLDEN_PATH.md)  
Platform skills: [`docs/PLATFORM.md`](docs/PLATFORM.md)

**Do not** ship hand-written VirtualService / EnvoyFilter YAML from
`apps/reference-app/kube/` to product teams — that tree is for **learning mesh
internals**. The operator generates those objects from the CR.

## Projects

| Project | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **reference-app** | [`apps/reference-app`](apps/reference-app/) | Sample payment app (empathy + mesh literacy) |
| **virtualization-framework** | [`apps/virtualization-framework`](apps/virtualization-framework/) | **Platform product** (operator + CRD) |
| **reference-app-with-framework** | [`examples/reference-app-with-framework`](examples/reference-app-with-framework/) | **Golden path** consumer recipe |

```
Empathy     make demo                 (local, no mesh)
Internals   make mesh-e2e             (hand Istio — learning only)
Platform    make platform-accept      (offline)
            make platform-e2e         (cluster golden path)  ← supported
```
